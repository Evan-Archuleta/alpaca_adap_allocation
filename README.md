# alpaca_adap_allocation

Notes:

1) resetting Alpaca's paper account will generate new keys and will need to be added into the config.py file
2) running explore.py in VS Code with right click run in interactive window will allow for plotting to be shown and updated 
3) from conda terminal:
conda activate alpaca
cd projects\alpaca\alpaca_adap_allocation
python explore.py
